    """Dashboard View Model.

    Uses the protonvpn library to take different actions.
    It uses the state variable to notify the View (which is
    listening and awaiting for any changes), to update the UI
    accordingly.

    Due to the fact that the protonvpn library uses GLib (which
    the UI is also running on) to add, start, remove and stop
    connections it is currently no possible to execute these
    in a thread/background to make the UI more fluid. Thus, the main thread
    is passed back and forth (from library to UI and vice-versa)
    to execute these processes. Thus, whenever possible, python threads
    are used so that the UI changes are more fluid.

    All threads should run in daemon mode, so that when the program is closed,
    all threads are also closed.
